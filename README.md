# HelicalFMO
Fragment Molecular Orbital analysis for interhelical transmembrane protein interactions

This code performs several operations:

1. Rotates helical transmembrane dimers and writes to PDB files.
2. Writes nearest residue-residue atomic records to PDF files. 
3. Generates GAMESS input file for FMO analysis based on nearest residue-residue PDB files.
4. Performs 1 to 3 at scale.
